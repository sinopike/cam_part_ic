some notes



This is where I upload lecture notes and potentially other things from my studies in Cambridge and Imperial College.

I am a lazy note taker so please don't rely on them. Some examples will be omitted, all plots will be ignored, typos vill be persent, and important details will be missed. I can't replace your lectures, I am not Dexter Chua.

btw, don't redistribute without permisson.
